# About This Experiment

## Background

We have shown that dendritic cells transiently appear at the pulp-dentin border just before odontoblasts are regenerated after tooth injury.

Therefore, we hypothesized that administration of CpG, a dendritic cell activator, to mice might promote pulp healing.

## Method

After extraction of the maxillary first molar, soak the tooth in CpG solution and wait for a certain time (the waiting time varies with the experiment). Then, the tooth is replanted. In the control group, saline was used.

Wait a few days (1, 3, 5, 7, 14 days) after replantation, fix the mouse and prepare tissue samples.

## Analysis

Confirm odontoblast differentiation by immunostaining with Nestin.

Next, calculate how much of the Nestin-positive area overlaps with the total circumference of the dentin-pulp border. ImageJ is used for this image processing.

Then, perform statistical analysis.

## Experiment 1（Preliminary Experiment）

CpG has type A and type B. Which was validated for pulp healing.

The experimental groups are type A, type B, and the control.

The specimens were fixed only at 14 days after replantation.

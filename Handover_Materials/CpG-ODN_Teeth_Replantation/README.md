# About This Experiment

## Background

We have shown that dendritic cells transiently appear at the pulp-dentin border just before odontoblasts are regenerated after tooth injury.

Therefore, we hypothesized that administration of CpG, a dendritic cell activator, to mice might promote pulp healing.

## Method

After extraction of the maxillary first molar, soak the tooth in CpG solution and wait for a certain time (the waiting time varies with the experiment). Then, the tooth is replanted. In the control group, PBS was used.

Wait a few days (1, 3, 5, 7, 14 days) after replantation, fix the mouse and prepare tissue samples.

## Analysis

Confirm odontoblast differentiation by immunostaining with Nestin.

Next, calculate how much of the Nestin-positive area overlaps with the total perimeter of the dentin-pulp border. ImageJ is used for this image processing.

Then, perform statistical analysis.

## Experiment 1: Preliminary Experiment

CpG has type A and type B. Which was validated for pulp healing.

The experimental groups are type A, type B, and the control.

The specimens were fixed only at 14 days after replantation.

### Results

The cure rate in the B group was significantly greater than the cure rate in the control group. Therefore, in subsequent experiments we began to use type B.

## Experiment 2: Intentional Delayed Replantation

To replicate clinical conditions, the teeth were immersed in CpG solution for 30 minutes. We call this an intentional delayed replantion.

The days to fix were 7 days and 14 days.

### Results
There are many specimens that have not healed due to pulpitis.

There was no significant difference between all group combinations.

The 7-day group showed a greater mean cure rate than the 14-day group. The healing process should have been more advanced in the 14-day group.

## Experiment 3: Detailed Verification

To scrutinize the healing process, we increased the groups determined by the number of days to fixation (1,3,5,7,14 days).

The content of the experiment was the same as in Experiment 1: Immediate replantion(soaking time: 1 min) were performed in 3-week-old ICR mice using a B-type solution.

### Results

When comparing groups with the same number of days to fixation, there was no significant difference between all five combinations.

In the PBS group, there was a significant difference between the 14-day group and the other groups. The same was shown for the B-type group. That is, the pulp healed 14 days after replantation regardless of which solution was used.

## Experimet 4: Extraction of opposing teeth

We hypothesized that the lack of significant differences in Experiments 2 and 3 might be due to occlusal trauma.

Studies in rats have shown that the most significant factor involved in pulp healing is the presence of congruent teeth. After replantation, the teeth are slightly higher than their original position, thus producing occlusal trauma.

Therefore, we extracted the mandibular first molar at the time of replantation.

The procedure was an immediate replantation. The time to fixation was 7 and 14 days.

### Results

In the control group, there was a significant difference between the 7-day and 14-day groups. Since it was originally shown in Experiment 3 that the 14-day group had a significantly higher cure rate, this result is consistent with the results. On the other hand, it was more curious that the difference was no longer significant in the B-type group.

In any case, the B-type solution did not promote pulp healing.

## Experiment 5: 2-week-old mice

We chose to use 2-week-old mice to exclude not only occlusal trauma but also the factor of bacterial infection. Therefore, the replanted teeth would be located below the gingival valve.

The time to fixation was 7,14 days, and the operative technique was intentional delayed reimplantation. The reason for not opting for immediate reimplantation was that it was clear that immediate reimplantation at 2 weeks of age would result in healing. That is, we thought it would heal even without the effects of the B-type solution.

### Results

There were no significant differences between all groups. Rather, looking only at the mean, the control group had a better cure rate.

## Experiment 6: Revising the experiment

In all experiments since Experiment 1, no results were obtained indicating the efficacy of the CpG solution. Therefore, the A-type solution was added again for validation.

Intentional delayed replanting was performed in 2-week-old mice. Two delay times of 30 and 60 minutes were prepared. The number of days to fixation was only 7 days.

### Results

With a delay time of 30 minutes, there was a significant difference between the control group and the type A group.

## Future Plans

Perform the same experiment with an A-type solution.

## Personal Opinion

The experiments so far are haphazard. The issue of multiplicity needs to be considered. If you repeat the experiment, there is a significant difference somewhere.

I have repeatedly explained to my professor that he said, "You are not trying hard enough, you should repeat the experiment under different conditions. You should repeat the experiment with different conditions.

That's right, if you repeat the experiment 10 times, the probability of finding a significant difference is 40%. If the results coincide with his opinion, the experiment is considered to be successful.
